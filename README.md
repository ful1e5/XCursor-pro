## XCursor-pro needs your Input

Until 2021 my cursors projects were well funded by [pling.com](https://www.pling.com) but since the
[pling-factor](https://www.pling.com/terms/payout) on the website has decreased and monthly payments
are <500$, It is now dependent on community funding and sponsorships. If you want to help me to maintain
XCursor-pro and my other open source projects actively, consider sponsoring my work on [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/ful1e5)
or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ful1e5) if your company would like to support my projects,
I will gladly look into it and post your avatar in the project's README.

I appreciate all the wonderful people who patronize and sponsoring my work.

#### Windows

**Installation:**

1. Unzip `.zip` file
2. Open unziped directory in Explorer, and **right click** on `install.inf`.

**OR** follow these steps:

1. Go to **Registry Editor** by typing the same in the _start search box_.
2. Expand `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` folder and expand `Control Panel` folder.
3. Go to `Cursors` folder and click on `Schemes` folder - all the available custom cursors that are
   installed will be listed here.
4. **Right Click** on the name of cursor file you want to uninstall; for eg.: _XCursor-Pro Cursors_ and
   click `Delete`.
5. Click '**yes**' when prompted.

## Build From Source

#### Notes

    -   See `ctgen --help` for all available options.
    -   **-c**: Theme comment.
    -   **-n**: The name you want to give to the generated theme.
    -   **-d**: bitmaps directory
    to change the following options in `ctgen` to build the appropriate variant:
    single configuration file `build.toml` is responsible for building all variants. Due to this, you will have

-   Since XCursor-Pro variants are designed similarly, they share the same hotspot settings so a
    file from a svg, Then you can use yarn because bitmapper is written in TypeScript.
    you don't need that. If you want to develop/modify XCursor-Pro's colors, and bitmaps, or generate a png
-   yarn is optional, For building XCursors and Windows cursors from `.png` files or resizing them
    excluding the render scripts. They are useful for converting `.svg` files to `.png` files.
-   Check out the scripts section in [package.json](./package.json) to see how we build the cursor theme,
-   XCursor-Pro build configuration and cursor hotspot settings are bundled in the `build.toml` file.

### Build prerequisites

-   [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)
-   [clickgen](https://github.com/ful1e5/clickgen)>=2.1.2 (`pip install clickgen`)
-   Python version 3.7 or higher

### Quick start

1. Install [build prerequisites](#build-prerequisites) on your system
2. `git clone https://github.com/ful1e5/XCursor-pro`
3. `cd XCursor-pro && yarn build`
4. See [Installing XCursor-Pro Cursor](#installing-xcursor-pro-cursor).

### Building

> **Note**
> Bitmaps are already generated in the `bitmaps` directory and **managed by the maintainer**
> (do not edit them directly).

First make sure you installed the [build prerequisites](#build-prerequisites).
Now that you have the dependencies, you can try build individual themes from bitmaps and
customize sizes, target platform, and etc. with the `ctgen` CLI (packed with `clickgen`).

#### `yarn build` aberration

Here are the default commands we used to build the XCursor-Pro's variants and packed them into `yarn build`:

```bash
ctgen build.toml -d 'bitmaps/XCursor-Pro-Dark' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Dark' -c 'Modern dark XCursors.'
ctgen build.toml -d 'bitmaps/XCursor-Pro-Light' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Light' -c 'Modern light XCursors.'
ctgen build.toml -d 'bitmaps/XCursor-Pro-Red' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Red' -c 'Modern Red XCursors.'
```

Afterwards, the themes can be found in the `themes` directory.

#### Customize Sizes

> **Note**
> You can change the cursor size up to 200 because pngs are rendered with 200x200.
> If the cursor is resized by more than rendered png size, the final cursor will be blurred.

##### Customize Windows Cursor size

To build Windows cursor with size `16`:

> **Warning**
> Windows cursor supports only one size, if multiple sizes are given with `-s` the first size will
> be considered in build.

```bash
ctgen build.toml -s 16 -p windows -d 'bitmaps/XCursor-Pro-Light' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Light' -c 'Modern light XCursor with size 16'
```

You can also customize output directory with `-o` option:

```bash
ctgen build.toml -s 16 -p windows -d 'bitmaps/XCursor-Pro-Light' -o 'out' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Light' -c 'Modern light XCursor with size 16'
```

##### Customize XCursor size

To build XCursor with size `16`:

```bash
ctgen build.toml -s 16 -p x11 -d 'bitmaps/XCursor-Pro-Light' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Light' -c 'Modern light XCursor with size 16'
```

You can also assign multiple sizes to `ctgen` for XCursors build:

```bash
ctgen build.toml -s 16 24 32 -p x11 -d 'bitmaps/XCursor-Pro-Light' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Light' -c 'Modern light XCursor'
```

#### Customize Colors

To customize XCursor-Pro's color you have to install node dependencies with `yarn install` command.
After installing dependencies you can customize the colors via `npx cbmp` Node CLI App which packed with
[cbmp](https://github.com/ful1e5/cbmp) node package.

##### `yarn render` aberration

Here are the default commands we used for generating the XCursor-Pro's bitmaps and packed them into `yarn render`:

```bash
npx cbmp -d 'svg' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Dark' -bc '#000000' -oc '#FFFFFF'
npx cbmp -d 'svg' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Light' -bc '#FFFFFF' -oc '#000000'
npx cbmp -d 'svg' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Red' -bc '#FF0000' -oc '#FFFFFF'
```

#### Examples

Lets generate modern XCursor-Pro with green base color and black outline:

```bash
npx cbmp -d 'svg' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Hacker' -bc '#00FE00' -oc '#000000'
```

After rendering custom color you have to build cursor through `ctgen`:

```bash
ctgen build.toml -d 'bitmaps/XCursor-Pro-Hacker' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Hacker' -c 'Green and black XCursor-Pro cursors.'
```

Afterwards, Generated theme can be found in the `themes` directory.

###### XCursor-Pro Gruvbox

```bash
npx cbmp -d 'svg' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Gruvbox' -bc '#282828' -oc '#EBDBB2'
ctgen build.toml -d 'bitmaps/XCursor-Pro-Gruvbox' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Gruvbox' -c 'Groovy XCursor-Pro cursors.'
```

###### XCursor-Pro Solarized Dark

```bash
npx cbmp -d 'svg' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Solarized-Dark' -bc '#002b36' -oc '#839496'
ctgen build.toml -d 'bitmaps/XCursor-Pro-Solarized-Dark' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Solarized-Dark' -c 'Solarized Dark XCursor-Pro cursors.'
```

###### XCursor-Pro Solarized Light

```bash
npx cbmp -d 'svg' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Solarized-Light' -bc '#839496' -oc '#002b36'
ctgen build.toml -d 'bitmaps/XCursor-Pro-Solarized-Light' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Solarized-Light' -c 'Solarized Light XCursor-Pro cursors.'
```

###### XCursor-Pro Dracula

```bash
npx cbmp -d 'svg' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Dracula' -bc '#282a36' -oc '#f8f8f2'
ctgen build.toml -d 'bitmaps/XCursor-Pro-Dracula' -n 'XCursor-Pro-Dracula' -c 'Dracula XCursor-Pro cursors.'
```
